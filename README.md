Equipment to test the pumps of Hemodialysis machines
This equipment has been develop with the purpuse of detect the intermittent failures in the pumps of hemodialysis machines, the hardware and software are based in arduino envioroment.
The EOS tester simulate the funtionality of the motor in the machine and monitoring the optical sensor, this sensor while the motor is working must be producing a pulse between 0 and 5v 
but if the system detect that the voltage remain in 5v during x time the microcontroller send and alarm.
